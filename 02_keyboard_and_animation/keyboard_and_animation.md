# Challenge 02 - Keyboard and animation

My second challenge deals with key presses and starting a new animation based on the key press. So for this challenge I chose to listen to key ```F``` and if that is pressed I want my character to play an animation I downloaded from [mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/)

The animation I downloaded is the ```salute``` animation and I used the following download settings;

and the animation looks like this;
